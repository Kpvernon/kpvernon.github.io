## Recipes I Recommand
Cooking is a hobby of mine. To me food is an important element of our everyday lives that can be therapudic and exciting. My husband was diagnosed with celiac disease in 2019. Going out can be risky so we try to cook at home as much as possible. This has also forced me to branch out and try new cuisines so we aren't stuck eating the same few recipes. I love trying to cook food brom other cultures as I one day hope to travel all a round the world.
* [Quesabirria Tacos- Sunday's Supper](https://sundaysuppermovement.com/quesabirria-tacos/)  
Quesabirria tacos are one of my favorite all time meals. The slow cooked beef melts and your mouth and the broth adds so much flavor. 
* [Maqluba- Hungry Paprikas](https://www.hungrypaprikas.com/maqluba/)
  * I had this famous middle eastern dish for the first time during my middle eastern art history class a few years ago. My professor made it for us on our last day. Maqluba actually mean up-side down because you cook it in a pot and then flip it over to realse it and serve it.
* [Brigadeiros \(Churro Truffles\)- Pies and Tacos](https://www.piesandtacos.com/dulce-de-leche-fudge-churros-truffles/)
* [Black Forest Flouress Brownie Cookies- The Loppy Whisk](https://theloopywhisk.com/2021/12/30/black-forest-flourless-brownie-cookies/)
  * These are my favorite cookies. They taste just like brownies but are also gluten free.
