## Recipes I Recommand
Cooking is a hobby of mine. To me food is an important element of our everyday lives that can be therapudic and exciting. My husband was diagnosed with celiac disease in 2019. Going out can be risky so we try to cook at home as much as possible. This has also forced me to branch out and try new cuisines so we aren't stuck eating the same few recipes. I love trying to cook food from other cultures as I one day hope to travel all around the world.
* [Quesabirria Tacos- Sunday's Supper](https://sundaysuppermovement.com/quesabirria-tacos/)  
  * Quesabirria tacos are one of my all time favorite meals. The slow cooked beef melts and your mouth and the broth adds so much flavor. 
* [Maqluba- Hungry Paprikas](https://www.hungrypaprikas.com/maqluba/)
  * I had this famous middle eastern dish for the first time during my middle eastern art history class a few years ago. My professor made it for us on our last day. Maqluba actually mean up-side down because you cook it in a pot and then flip it over to release it and serve it.
  * [Black Forest Flouress Brownie Cookies- The Loppy Whisk](https://theloopywhisk.com/2021/12/30/black-forest-flourless-brownie-cookies/)
  * These are my favorite cookies. They taste just like brownies but are also gluten free.
* [Brigadeiros \(Churro Truffles\)- Pies and Tacos](https://www.piesandtacos.com/dulce-de-leche-fudge-churros-truffles/)
  * Brigadeiros are small confectionary that orginated in Brazil. They come in a varity of flavors. During the fall I make them festive by making shaped like pumpkins. I use a tooth pic and indent the sides, then use a small chocolate for the stem. ![Brigadeiro pumpkins](https://i.imgur.com/zJjM0QT.jpeg)
